# About me
I am currently an MD/PhD student in Professor Matthew Lew’s lab at Washington University in St. Louis. I engineer optical imaging hardware, software, and fluorescent probes to investigate how the conformations and orientations of biological structures (e.g. viral surface proteins, amyloid-beta fibrils) affect their biophysical properties and interactions. My goal is to understand how these conformational dynamics modulate disease pathogenesis and cellular responses to infection.
